30th Sept:

1. More Intuitive clarity on Power-spectrum smoothing because of lensing
2. What is "Shape Noise" in CMB polarisaion B modes in the context of CMB Lensing?
3. WHy the divergence of the temperature-weighted gradient as the optimal quadratic combination of the CMB temperature for use in lensing studies?
4. What is "coherence length of the polarization" in the context of this line "Even with polarization information these quadratic estimators cannot improve the reconstruction beyond a certain level, set by the coherence length of the polarization" in page 2
5. How lensed power of the CMB polarisation modes is related to the unlensed power?

7th Oct:

1. The lensing has the grad and the curl part. How does C_lAA looks like? WHy the curl part becomes more important as low noise?
2. Try to get more intuitive idea why Eq2 from \phi_l.
3. What is exactly get_response and get_N0s? What is the relation between these two?
