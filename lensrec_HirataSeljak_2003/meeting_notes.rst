-----------

1. More Intuitive clarity on Power-spectrum smoothing because of lensing
    * ..
2. What is "Shape Noise" in CMB polarisaion B modes in the context of CMB Lensing?
3. WHy the divergence of the temperature-weighted gradient as the optimal quadratic combination of the CMB temperature for use in lensing studies?
    * Eq. 7.8 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0601594.pdf
4. What is "coherence length of the polarization" in the context of this line "Even with polarization information these quadratic estimators cannot improve the reconstruction beyond a certain level, set by the coherence length of the polarization" in page 2
    * Refers to the lensed power spectra
5. How lensed power of the CMB polarisation modes is related to the unlensed power?

7th Oct:
-----------

1. The lensing has the grad and the curl part. How does C_lAA looks like? WHy the curl part becomes more important as low noise?
     * Red curve in the left plot of Figure 2 of https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05662
2. Try to get more intuitive idea why Eq2 from \phi_l.
3. What is exactly get_response and get_N0s? What is the relation between these two?
